This is a python version of the BumpHunter algorithm, see [arXiv:1101.0390, G. Choudalakis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0390), designed to find localized excess (or deficit) of events in a 1D or 2D distribution.

The main BumpHunter function will scan a data distribution using variable-width window sizes and calculate the p-value of data with respect to a given background distribution in each window. The minimum p-value obtained from all windows is the local p-value. To cope with the "look-elsewhere effect" a global p-value is calculated by performing background-only pseudo-experiments.

The BumpHunter algorithm can also perform signal injection tests where more and more signal is injected in toy data until a given signal significance (global) is reached (*signal injection not available in 2D yet*).

### Dependencies

Requires Python >= 3.8.

BumpHunter depends on the following python libraries :

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

### [pyBumpHunter wiki](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyBumpHunter/wiki)

### Examples

The examples provided in example.py and test.ipynb require the [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot) package in
order to read the data from a [ROOT software](https://root.cern.ch/) file.

The data provided in the example consists of three histograms: a steeply falling 'background' distribution in a [0,20] x-axis range, a 'signal' gaussian shape centered on a value of 5.5, and a 'data' distribution sampled from background and signal distributions, with a signal fraction of 0.15%. The data file is produced by running gen_data.C in ROOT.

In order to run the example script, simply type `python3 example.py` in a terminal.

You can also open the example notebook with jupyter or binder.
